# ClipRetain
## Description
Clipboard (copy history) retainer/manager

## Motivation
I haven't touched C# in a LONG time; the last major (i.e. publicly released) project I worked on a C# project was eons ago, on a project called "RoboDown" https://sourceforge.net/projects/rapiddown/, in 2009. I have been itching to get into C# again and what better way than to start with a WPF application?
 
Right off bat, there were two goals to achieve by creating this project:
 1. Get practical experience in C#
 2. Create something meaningful, while at it

## Initial work (v1.0 goals)
1. Text only operations/abilities for this tool

## ToDo (in no particular order)
1. Capability of swapping contents
   - i.e. item #4 with #8 etc., in the ClipRetain history list
2. Removal of multiple items from the ClipRetain history list
