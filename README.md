# ClipRetain

## Description
Clipboard (copy history) retainer/manager

## Motivation
I haven't touched C# in a LONG time; the last major (i.e. publicly released) C# project I worked on was eons ago, on a project called "[RoboDown](https://sourceforge.net/projects/rapiddown/)", in 2009. I have been itching to get into C# again and what better way than to start with a WPF application?
 
Right off bat, there were two goals to achieve by creating this project:
 1. Get practical experience in C#
 2. Create something meaningful, while at it
